## Hi there, I'm Kiara

### Bio: About Me
I'm Kiara (she/her), a UI/UX student at ASU from Colorado.  I have had previous experience coding in C, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and a few others.  I am a big fan of hiking, skiing, and swimming.  I am an avid reader (my favorite book is Ready Player One by Ernest Cline) and a board game fan (my favorite is Nyctophobia).  I am always looking for good book/board game suggestions!
